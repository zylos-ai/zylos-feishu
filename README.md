---

- **Talk through Feishu** — your AI agent speaks Feishu, both private chats and group conversations
- **Smart group monitoring** — automatically follow designated group discussions, no @mention needed
- **Zero-config start** — first message auto-binds you as admin, no setup wizards
- **Rich Feishu integration** — documents, spreadsheets, calendar — not just messaging

## Getting Started

Tell your Zylos agent:

> "Install the feishu component"

Or use the CLI:

```bash
zylos add feishu
```

Zylos will guide you through the setup, including configuring your Feishu app credentials. Once installed, message your bot on Feishu — the first user to interact becomes the admin.

## Managing the Bot

Just tell your Zylos agent what you need:

| Task | Example |
|------|---------|
| Add user to whitelist | "Add user xxx to feishu whitelist" |
| Enable smart group | "Make this group a smart group" |
| Check status | "Show feishu bot status" |
| Restart bot | "Restart feishu bot" |
| Upgrade | "Upgrade feishu component" |
| Uninstall | "Uninstall feishu component" |

Or manage via CLI:

```bash
zylos upgrade feishu
zylos uninstall feishu
```

## Group Chat Behavior

| Scenario | Bot Response |
|----------|--------------|
| Private chat (owner/whitelisted) | Responds via Claude |
| Smart group message | Receives all messages |
| @mention in allowed group | Responds with recent context |
| Owner @mention in any group | Always responds |
| Unknown user | Ignored |
